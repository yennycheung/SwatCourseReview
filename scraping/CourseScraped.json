In form and content, silent-era cinema functioned as both a vector and a reflection of the transformative subjective and social experiences of modernity. Urbanization, immigration, consumerism, and women\u2019s participation in the labor force were refracted in silent movie genres and stars. We will pay special attention to cinema\u2019s internationalism before the introduction of synchronized sound, looking at film culture and national film stars in Asia as well as the U.S. and Europe. Field trips and guests will address key topics of silent film historiography including archives and preservation and film music. Required weekly evening screenings."

The department strongly recommends that students take MATH 034 instead, which is offered every semester and provides a richer understanding of this material by requiring linear algebra (MATH 027 or 028) as a prerequisite. Students may take only one of MATH 033, MATH 034, and MATH 035 for credit.\n\nPrerequisite: MATH 025, or 026 or placement by examination (see \u201cAdvanced Placement and Credit Policy\u201d section).

He, along with his wife Livia, transformed Rome by creating a monarchical system that hid the real power behind the traditional institutions of the Roman republic. The process was supported and explained by a unique program of literary, artistic, and architectural revival. Ancient authors to be read (in English) may include Augustus himself, Livy, Vergil, Horace, Propertius and Ovid; we will also study the artistic and architectural projects that helped to communicate the ideologies of the new regime.\n\nSocial sciences. 1 credit."

Topics will include mathematical induction and other methods of proof, recurrence relations, counting, and graph theory. Additional topics may include algorithms, and probability. There is a strong emphasis on good mathematical writing, especially proofs. While it does not use any calculus, MATH 029 is a more sophisticated course than MATH 15 or MATH 25; thus success in a calculus course demonstrates the mathematical maturity needed for MATH 29.\n\nPrerequisite: Strong knowledge of at least precalculus, as evidenced by taking another mathematics course numbered 15 or above, or through our placement examinations (see \u201cPlacement Procedure\u201d section). Familiarity with some computer language is helpful but not necessary."

Students will get a broad overview of Classical mythology through direct and close readings of primary sources (all in English translation), including such texts as Homer's , plays by all three of the major Greek tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides), and Ovid's . Our readings of ancient texts will be supplemented by study of ancient art and frequent investigations of modern responses to and theorizing of myth in diverse fields and media, including sociological, psychological, and philosophical treatises; modern poetry; visual arts; and film.\n\nHumanities. 1 credit."

Students will read twelve first chapters, from twelve chronologically chosen novels, to see how first chapters have developed since Fielding first worried about the nature of the novel, and to analyze what brilliant practitioners such as Dickens, Wharton and Nabokov have done since. In tandem with this, each student will develop their own first chapter, rewriting it in light of these different approaches, whether it be Sterne\u2019s taking the reader back to the very beginning, Austen\u2019s oblique wry introduction of the main characters, or Amis\u2019 roadmap for the novel ahead. As we discuss these very different approaches, the students will comment on each other\u2019s writing as they experiment with and hone their own first chapters, while also keeping in mind, and discovering, the novel beyond. Readings will average one first chapter per week for everyone, with one student designated the entire novel, so we can discuss how that first chapter pays off in the work as a whole. The instructor will also be demonstrating the use of the first chapter in his own work.\n\nThis Master Class in Fiction is intended for students who have taken the introductory fiction workshop (ENGL 070B) or \u2013 with the instructor\u2019s permission \u2013 similar fiction workshops at Penn, Bryn Mawr, or Haverford. Class is limited to 12 students, accepted on the basis of a writing sample (maximum of 15 double-spaced pages) due April 1. Admission and credit are granted at the discretion of the instructor. Limited to 12. Pre-requisite: Normally 070B. See description above.\n\nGraded credit/no credit.\n\n071A\u2013Z: Genre Studies"

Many believe that the expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with others - competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. In this course, we review current theories and methods guiding social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience, taking a multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context.\n\nPrerequisite: PSYC 001.\n\nSocial sciences."

We will read and discuss a range of studies employing these methods. Throughout the semester students will gain firsthand experience using these methods. This course will include a significant community-based learning component. Students will help to design a research study for a public elementary school, Andrew Jackson Elementary, in Philadelphia. This study will focus on why parents choose charter schools rather than their local neighborhood school. The project will aid Jackson in its efforts to attract more families from the surrounding neighborhood and may contribute to a critical debate about school choice in Philadelphia.\n\nMethods course."

This course asks students to push against conventional wisdom, the \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201cpermanent\u201d truths of political and social life, to seek falsifiable, testable explanations for the anomalies, gaps, and mysteries in the domestic politics of states and countries. Lectures, essays, and classroom debates will return over and over again to the following questions: What constitutes legitimate authority, and how is it reproduced? We will seek out answers by exploring how states, regimes, and governments in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and the Middle East conciliate difference and change, violently and non-violently, in relation to their respective societies."

Furthermore, we will study the fundamental theoretical concepts and theories of international relations. Using these theories, students will be able to sort through arguments about various topics in international relations and make judgment calls for yourself. Finally, students will learn how these concepts have evolved over time and how we can use them to hypothesize what lies ahead for international relations."

We will look at three central issues of politics\u2014 1) Justice; 2) Freedom; 3) Power, Knowledge and Values\u2014over the course of the semester. The course proceeds topically as well as chronologically, and we will return to certain primary classic theory texts more than once. Primary texts will include Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx and Foucault, as well as texts that present a contemporary perspective on each issue.\n\nThis course examines a range of arguments about the principles of justice\u2014including rights, duties, utility, individual dignity, equality, and autonomy\u2014 that should govern our everyday behavior and our political experience. Authors include canonical theorists such as Plato, Xenophon, Kant, Bentham, Mill, Marx and Nietzsche, as well as more recent theorists such as Nozick, Rawls, Sandel and Nussbaum. Students will draw upon five modern movies (and) as a means of grounding the questions in a contemporary sensibility."

Often regarded as the founder of German classicism, Goethe\u2019s literary writings, spanning over six decades, defy easy categorization. Texts read in the seminar include the early drama G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen and the influential epistolary novel The Sorrows of Young Werther, the classical drama Iphigenie auf Tauris, the novels Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre and Die Wahlverwandtschaften, early essays on Shakespeare and Gothic architecture, poetry from all periods of his life, and, of course, Faust. We will also look at Goethe\u2019s scientific ideas (morphology of plants and theory of optics) and his philosophical and economic worldview."

Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions. Readings are typically drawn from the works of both traditional and contemporary thinkers with distinctive, carefully argued, and influential views regarding knowledge, morality, mind, and meaning. Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\nEach semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as\n\nwell as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n\u201cMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth\u2014more than ruin, more than even death.\u201d Bertrand Russell believed that education\u2019s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know."

Through a multidisciplinary perspective, we will study the interaction of social, political, ethnic, and gender dynamics and its resulting transformations in Latin America. After a study of pre-European contact and Amerindian civilizations, we will examine critically the moment of contact between the Old and the New World and the ensuing conflicts that characterized the three centuries of colonial rule in Latin America. Later, we will focus on the nation building process and the cultural campaigns of turn-of-the-century elites, the causes and consequences of U.S. interventions, the dilemmas of economic development, the rise of state terror, and the lives of transnational migrants today. Lectures and textbook readings provide a panoramic analysis of complex cultural processes (colonialism, transculturation, modernization, globalization, etc.); documentaries and films provide other points of entry as we think through the processes that have shaped Latin America.\n\nPrerequisite: SPAN 004 or the equivalent or permission of the instructor.\n\nOffered each fall."

The course is intended for students who want a practical introduction to statistical methods and who intend to do, or think they may eventually do, statistical analysis, especially in the biological and social sciences. Students who receive credit on entrance for the Statistics AP Exam should not take this course; they have placed out of it and will lose their AP credit if they take it. Note that STAT 011 overlaps considerably with ECON 031; both courses cover similar topics, although ECON 031 focuses more on economic applications while STAT 011 draws examples from a variety of disciplines.\n\nPrerequisite: Four years of traditional high school mathematics (precalculus).\n\nEach semester."

What do these narratives reveal about national, cultural and individual identity formation during early stages of maturity? How are these narratives shaped by various political and historical contexts? In addition to works by authors such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Frank Wedekind, Ingeborg Bachmann, Bernhard Schlink, and Jana Hensel, we will also examine key theoretical texts and films that focus on narratives of youth."

Must we choose? And are these questions themselves, and the talk they generate or suppress, yet another manifestation of the Western European and American commodification of art, its production, and its consumption? Such questions will underlie this introduction to the goals, methods, and history of art history. Focusing on works drawn from a variety of cultures and epochs, as well as on the art historical and critical attention those works have attracted, students will learn to describe, analyze, and interpret both images and their interpretations and to convey their own assessments in lucid writing and speaking."

In particular, students will learn the steps in the accounting cycle leading up to the preparation and analysis of corporate financial statements. Students are also exposed to some of the fundamental differences between federal tax rules and external financial reporting requirements and are made aware of the organizations that influence and contribute to the body of knowledge in financial accounting. Finally, ethical issues that may be confronted by the accountant are also discussed throughout the course.\n\nPrerequisite: ECON 001.\n\nEach semester. Hargadon."

Topics covered include how beliefs about health, disease and the body are constructed and transmitted, how healers are chosen and trained, social disparities in health and illness, and the importance of narrative and performance in the effectiveness of healing practices. Finally, we will consider the ways in which medical anthropology can shed light upon important contemporary medical and social concerns.\n\nTheory course."

Each section addresses a few of these questions to introduce a range of sharply contrasting positions.

Close attention is paid to formulating questions precisely and to the technique of analyzing arguments through careful consideration of texts.\n\nEach semester. Staff.\n\nSection 1: Knowledge and Agency\n\nWhat shall I do? What are the demands of morality? What is their basis (if there is one)? What is freedom of the will and do we enjoy it? Why is death bad? What is the meaning of life? (Does it have a meaning?) What can we know? What is knowledge? Are we just material beings or do we possess an immaterial (and, perhaps immortal) soul? These are and have always been fundamental philosophical questions. We will deal with them by reading and discussing classical as\n\nwell as contemporary philosophical texts.\n\nSection 3: Truth and Desire\n\nThis course is designed to develop your natural ability to think philosophically by heightening your sense of wonder and honing your critical skills. We will take a historical approach, starting with Plato and then reading Descartes and Nietzsche before turning to more contemporary theorists like Frantz Fanon and Sandra Bartky. Throughout the course, we will pursue questions about truth (What is it? How does it relate to knowledge? When do we know that we know?) as well as questions about desire (What do we want? How does that relate to what we should want, our ideas of the good life, and the kind of life we should lead?) and the relationship between the two.\n\nSection 4: Knowledge and the World\n\n\u201cMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth\u2014more than ruin, more than even death.\u201d Bertrand Russell believed that education\u2019s primary goal should be to instill in students not only the ability to seek knowledge, but also the desire for it, the joy of it, and the appreciation of its power. For Russell, this was also an essential component of philosophy. In this course, we will investigate the quest for knowledge itself: what are we looking for and how should we be looking for it? We will read some of the canonical answers to these questions as well as some answers that are not so canonical. We will ask what knowledge is, what kinds of knowledge we can have, and what it is exactly that we can know."

We will also focus on beginning to analyze text, understanding scene-work and monologues in relation to an entire play, listening and responding to self, others and space, and developing the ability to play actions. Finally, each student will have the opportunity to test our principles of work through one scene with a partner, no longer than ten minutes, to be assigned by the instructor.

In addition to theoretical questions, we will investigate one of the hottest debates in contemporary political science: whether political participation, social connectedness, and general cooperation have declined in the United States over the past half-century. If so, why? What might be done? We will consider the potential civic impact of economic and social marginalization in inner-city areas, the role of education in promoting civic engagement, the problem of civic and political disengagement among America\u2019s youth, and the potential for the Internet and other communications technology to resuscitate democratic engagement among the citizenry.

This course will provide students with an introduction to the origin and evolution of ideas about development, and will encourage them to examine major theories and approaches to development from classical modernization theories to world-systems theories. Students will gain insight into how ideas of development fit into larger global dynamics of power and politics and how, contrary to professed goals, the practices of international development have often perpetuated poverty and widened the gap between rich and poor. During the course, we will investigate these issues through an array of texts that address different audiences including a novel, academic books and journals, film, popular writings and ethnographic monographs.\n\nTheory course and writing course."
